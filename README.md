# Sorting_Algorithms
 
This program tests how much time it takes to sort a randomized array of 10,000 ints using
a variety of different sorting algorithms. It uses mergesort, concurrent mergesort,
bubblesort, insertionsort, selectionsort, quicksort, concurrent quicksort, random
quicksort, concurrent random quicksort, cocktail sort, heapsort, and shellsort. It then
prints out the time each sorting algorithm takes.
